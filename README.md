## README

This project checks whether the number 2 is even or odd. I made this project due to the fact that it's always a hassle to check this for my projects.

To deploy this into your project, simply:
1. Add the App.java file into your Java project
2. Rename it as you like
3. Done, in order to call from another Script, you can simply do [Name].checkIfNumber2isOdd()
